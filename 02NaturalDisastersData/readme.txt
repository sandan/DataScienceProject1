All SQL INSERT statements were generated via http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-sql.htm
from CSV files obtained online (see the 00Docs/NDisasters.html file for references) except
for the seismic data which was obtained using the python script seismic_csv_to_sql.py.

The .dmd file and folders were obtained by saving the data model in sql data modeler.
